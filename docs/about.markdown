OPTIMAL-IPB (Oil Palm Trees Identification based on Machine Learning – IPB University) is an open access plugin in Quantum GIS software used to detect oil palm trees canopy on high-resolution satellite images. This plugin was developed based on deep learning models on Retinanet architecture implemented on the repository by [Fizyr](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet). Some modifications were applied to enhance the model’s accuracy in detecting oil palm trees canopy as small objects. OPTIMAL_IPB was built by researchers from the [Center for Regional System, Analysis, Planning and Development (P4W/CRESTPENT)](https://p4w.ipb.ac.id), IPB University, Indonesia. It was based on research funded by RISPRO program held by the [Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP)](https://lpdp.kemenkeu.go.id/) – the Ministry of Finance.
